<h1>Custom Solar Eclipse Viewer</h1>

This project was created in order to produce a customized solar eclipse viewer.

<P>The idea is to improve your experience of a total eclipse by combining an eclipse viewer (eclipse glasses) with useful localized data and simple tools, 
all printed on a medium-sized card which you can hang around your neck.

<P>The steps to produce a custom solar eclipse viewer:
<ul>
 <li>edit a configuration file (a simple text file) to specify the date of the eclipse, your viewing location, and other data
 <li>run the code provided here to read in the configuration file as input, and produce a PDF file as output
 <li>print the PDF on card stock (stiff paper)
 <li>cut out the outlined viewing hole, and glue filter material over the hole for safely viewing the partial phases of the eclipse (the filter material should be purchased from a trusted source)
 <li>punch out a round hole in the center of the card (for shadow-casting)
 <li>punch out a round hole at the bottom of the card (for a lanyard)
</ul>

<h2>Features Of The Viewer</h2>
<ul>
 <li>the eclipse viewer is used to look at the partial phases of the eclipse
 <li>a small hole in the <em>center</em> of the card creates an image of the Sun in the shadow of the viewer
 <li>a small hole at the <em>bottom</em> of the card is for a lanyard, such that the card can simply hang around your neck when you aren't using it to view the partial phases
 <li>a QR code links to a web page you specify (recommended: link to a satellite image of the current cloud cover in your area)
 <li>if clouds are threatening to obscure totality, you can use rulers printed on the sides of the viewer to measure their angular separation and motion relative to the Sun
 <li>a timeline specific to your chosen location includes reminders of what to look for during the countdown to totality (shadow effects, shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect)
 <li>a chart shows the location of bright planets visible during totality
 <li>a timeline chart shows the progress of the partial phases of the eclipse
 <li>important data about the eclipse from your location: times, length of totality, altitude of the Sun above the horizon, and so on
</ul>
