<h1>Custom Solar Eclipse Viewer</h1>

This project was created in order to produce a customized solar eclipse viewer.

<P>The idea is to improve your experience of a total eclipse by combining an eclipse viewer (eclipse glasses) with useful localized data and simple tools, 
all printed on a medium-sized card which you can hang around your neck.

<P>An example is <a href='EclipseViewer.pdf'>here</a>.

<P>The steps to produce a custom solar eclipse viewer:
<ul>
 <li>edit a <code>config.ini</code> file (a simple text file) to specify the date of the eclipse, your viewing location, and other settings.
 <li>run the code provided here to read in the <code>config.ini</code> file as input, and produce a PDF file as output.
 <li>print the PDF on card stock (stiff paper). Print as two-sided.
 <li>cut out the outlined viewing hole, and glue appropriate filter material over the hole for safely viewing the partial phases of the eclipse.
 The filter material should be purchased from a trusted source.
 <li>punch out a round hole near the center of the card, to be used for looking at its shadow.
 <li>punch out a round hole at the bottom of the card, intended for a lanyard to hang around your neck.
</ul>

<h2>Features Of The Viewer</h2>
<ul>
 <li>the eclipse viewer is used to look at the partial phases of the eclipse.
 <li>a small hole near the <em>center</em> of the card creates an image of the Sun in the shadow of the viewer.
 <li>a small hole at the <em>bottom</em> of the card is for a lanyard, such that the card can simply hang around your neck when you aren't using it to view the partial phases.
 <li>QR codes link to a web page you specify (recommended: link to a satellite image of the current cloud cover in your area).
 <li>if clouds are threatening to obscure totality, you can use scales printed on the sides of the viewer to measure their angular separation and motion relative to the Sun.
 <li>a timeline specific to your chosen location includes reminders of what to look for during the countdown to totality (shadow effects, shadow bands, Baily's beads, and the diamond ring effect).
 <li>charts show the progress of the partial phases of the eclipse.
 <li>important data about the eclipse from your location is included: times, length of totality, altitude of the Sun above the horizon, and so on.
</ul>


<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
<ul>
 <li>the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/custom-solar-eclipse-viewer/blob/master/src/custom/solar/eclipse/viewer/math/Polynomial.java'>Polynomial</a> 
 class is a neat little thing.
 <li>Code that lets me mix-and-match <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html'>AffineTransform</a> objects. 
 This was very useful in removing repeated code, in making geometrical operations made up of several sequential operations easy to implement and understand.
 This is implemented in the <a href='https://github.com/johanley/custom-solar-eclipse-viewer/tree/master/src/custom/solar/eclipse/viewer/draw/mix'>custom.solar.eclipse.draw.mix</a> package.
</ul>

<h2>References</h2>
<ul>
 <li><em>Elements of Solar Eclipses</em>, Jean Meeus, 1989. This was my main reference. 
 <li><em>Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris</em>, 1961.
</ul>

<h2>Remarks Regarding Meeus' Documentation</h2>

<p>On page 26, equation (7) for the parallactic angle, I use the South Celestial Pole when the location is in the southern hemisphere. 
 (His remark about <em>cos q</em> being the same sign as <em>Î·</em> may amount to the same thing; I'm not sure.)

<P> On page 27, <em>The times of interior contacts...</em> should reference the absolute value of <em>L2'</em>, not <em>L2'</em> itself.
 
<P>On page 27, there seems to be a small numerical error in the worked example, for the value of <em>H</em>.
The stated value of 1.411188 should be 1.411192, according to his data. 
This amounts only to a very small angle, on the order of 0.01 arc-seconds.
(The source of the difference may be in the value of a constant.) 

<P>Meeus doesn't mention that there can be a  <em>change of day</em> in the calculation of local circumstances. 
That is, the correction applied to <em>T0</em> may push the value out of the range 0..24.
