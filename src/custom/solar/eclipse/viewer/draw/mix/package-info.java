/** 
 Mix and match various ways of writing and drawing: circles, lines, bold, italic, font size, centering, orientation, and so on.
 
 <P>This involves temporarily changing the state of the graphics context in different ways.
 
 <P>Centering operations are sensitive to the font details. 
 So the font needs to be completely set before the centering operation.
